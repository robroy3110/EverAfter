# **EverAfter**

**EverAfter** is a gamified mobile application designed to help couples grow together, stay motivated, and preserve meaningful shared memories. The app focuses especially on couples in long-distance relationships who enjoy music and gaming. Through a points system, shared goals, and interactive features, the app transforms relationship activities into a collaborative journey. This project was developed as part of the **Mobile Computing 23/24 course** at FCUL.

## Goals

This section allows couples to define goals they want to achieve together by the end of the year in different areas such as experiences, gaming, and music. Completing goals rewards points, reinforcing motivation through gamification.

## Memories

Couples can capture and store special moments using the app’s built-in camera. Each photo includes location data and can be viewed either in an album format or displayed on a map, creating a visual journey of shared experiences.

## Gaming

This page presents a list of co-op games. Users receive daily notifications about new free co-op games (simulated API system). They can favorite games and earn points by claiming the games that they have played.

## Playlists

Couples can create shared playlists using songs available in the app. Listening to the same music at the same time allows them to earn points, turning music into a shared bonding activity.
